doing hello-world repository demo
I am somewhat new to programming have created a couple games through unity as well as handled all the script. meaning non-tutorial,I Have learned most of the basics with javascript, python, c#, c++. I read somewhere that its better to learn several languages at the basics then pick a prefered language after that. I've kind of hit a roadblock going from beginner to intermediate, so ive decided to try free code camp.
